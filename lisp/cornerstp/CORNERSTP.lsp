;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Corner step layout routine for swimming-pool corners.
;;; Written for AutoCAD 2018 (plain AutoLISP + ActiveX for dim styles).
;;;
;;; LOAD:     APPLOAD this file (or drag it into the drawing window).
;;; COMMAND:  CORNERSTP
;;;
;;; WHAT IT DOES
;;;   Draws a run of parallel corner steps (tread edges) fanning out from
;;;   a pool corner toward the pool.  Tread depths are always held
;;;   exactly; step widths are held to within the width tolerance of the
;;;   wall opening (1/8" by default).
;;;
;;; WORKFLOW
;;;   1.  Select the two walls that form the corner.  Walls may be LINEs
;;;       or straight segments of a POLYLINE.  A corner diagonal
;;;       (chamfer) or a fillet ARC may be included in the same
;;;       selection.  If more than two straight walls are selected you
;;;       are asked to pick the two you mean.
;;;   2.  If the two walls intersect at a point, that intersection is
;;;       the starting point.
;;;   3.  Choose the draw direction [Inside out/Outside in]:
;;;         INSIDE OUT (default) - steps are built from the corner out
;;;         toward the pool from given tread depths and step widths.
;;;         OUTSIDE IN - the furthest (outermost) step is placed first
;;;         from its given width, bounded to the provided walls, and
;;;         the remaining steps walk back in toward the corner.
;;;
;;;   INSIDE OUT:
;;;   4a. If a diagonal/arc was selected, you are asked whether tread
;;;       depths are measured from the Middle of the diagonal/arc or
;;;       from the True corner.  The true corner is found by extending
;;;       the two walls surrounding the diagonal/arc to their apparent
;;;       intersection.
;;;   4b. If a diagonal was selected you are also asked whether the
;;;       treads run Parallel to the diagonal, or perpendicular to the
;;;       bisector of the TRUE ANGLE the walls make (equal angle from
;;;       both walls).  With no diagonal the true-angle bisector is
;;;       always used.  Tread depths are measured from the starting
;;;       point toward the pool, square to the treads, so all steps are
;;;       parallel to each other either way.
;;;   4c. For each step you are prompted for the tread depth, then the
;;;       step width:
;;;         - The tread depth is ALWAYS held exactly.
;;;         - If the wall opening at that depth is within the width
;;;           tolerance of the requested width, the step is trimmed to
;;;           the walls.
;;;         - Otherwise the requested width is held, centered between
;;;           the two walls so the step runs EQUALLY past (or equally
;;;           short of) both walls, and the step breaks away from the
;;;           walls to hold the given dimensions.
;;;         - Enter at the width prompt fits that one step to the walls.
;;;
;;;   OUTSIDE IN:
;;;   5a. If a diagonal was selected you are asked whether the steps
;;;       run Parallel to the diagonal, or with their endpoints
;;;       Equidistant from the true corner (square to the true-angle
;;;       bisector).  With no diagonal, equidistant is always used.
;;;   5b. You give the width of the furthest (outermost) step.  That
;;;       step is bounded to the provided walls, so its width alone
;;;       places it - it is just the starting point.  Each following
;;;       step asks for a tread depth (walking back in toward the
;;;       corner), then a step width, under the same rules as inside
;;;       out.  Drawing stops if the corner is reached.
;;;
;;;   6.  You are asked whether to dimension the steps [Yes/No].  If
;;;       Yes, aligned dimensions are added:
;;;         - Tread depths are chained along the bisector out from the
;;;           starting point, in dim style "STANDARD INCHES".
;;;         - Step widths are the full width of each tread edge, placed
;;;           just outside the corner and nested so the wider (deeper)
;;;           steps sit progressively further out, in dim style
;;;           "SIDE STANDARD".
;;;       If a style is missing the current style is used and a note is
;;;       printed.
;;;   7.  Enter at a tread depth prompt means no more steps are
;;;       required.  Back at a tread depth prompt steps back one step:
;;;       it removes the step just drawn (its lines and its dimensions)
;;;       so a mistyped number does not cost the whole run (Undo, the
;;;       old keyword, is still accepted).  Same repeats the previous
;;;       tread depth.  Side (riser) lines are drawn between successive step
;;;       ends whenever the walls do not already close that edge.
;;;
;;; OPTIONAL SETTINGS (set these before running the command)
;;;   *CS-WIDTH-TOL*      step width tolerance in drawing units.  When
;;;                       nil (the default) it is 1/8" converted through
;;;                       the drawing's INSUNITS setting.
;;;   *CS-DEPTH-DIMSTYLE* dim style for tread-depth dims.
;;;   *CS-WIDTH-DIMSTYLE* dim style for step-width dims.
;;;   *CS-DIM-LAYER*      layer for the dimensions.  When nil (the
;;;                       default) the current layer is used.
;;;
;;; NOTES
;;;   - Geometry is assumed to be drawn in plan view.  The routine warns
;;;     when the current UCS is not World, when selected geometry is not
;;;     flat, and when the current layer is off/frozen/locked.
;;;   - Steps are drawn as LINEs on the current layer.
;;;   - DIMSCALE (or the annotation scale for annotative styles) sets
;;;     the dimension size; grab a dimension line to slide it if it
;;;     lands awkwardly.
;;;   - One U / UNDO reverses the whole command.
