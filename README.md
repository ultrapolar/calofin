# Export UV Layout to DXF (AutoCAD) — Blender add-on

A Blender add-on (Blender 4.2+ including 5.0) that exports the UV layout
of the active mesh object as an **AutoCAD-compatible DXF** (R12 /
AC1009) file, aimed at flat-pattern work: leather, upholstery, sheet
metal, CNC/laser cutting.

## Features

### 1. Mirroring & rotation fixing
Unwrapped islands often end up flipped or arbitrarily rotated in UV
space. On export the add-on re-orients them to match the 3D viewport:

* **Mirroring** is detected from normal data: Blender face loops run
  counter-clockwise when viewed from the front (normal side) of a face,
  so an island whose UV winding is clockwise is mirrored relative to the
  3D surface. Such islands are un-mirrored.
* **Rotation** is fixed by comparing the positions of shared edges
  between islands. A *base island* is chosen per connected group of
  islands — only islands that share edges with exactly **one** other
  island qualify (islands sharing edges with two or more other islands
  are excluded from the candidate pool; the largest qualifying island
  wins). Every other island is then rotated, spreading outward from the
  base island, so each shared seam edge points the same way as it does
  in its already-oriented neighbour — the way the pieces would fold
  together in 3D.

Because re-orientation rotates islands in place (about their centroid),
pieces *can* end up overlapping in the drawing. Enable **Re-pack
Islands** to lay them out in non-overlapping rows instead.

### 2. Perimeter-only export
Only the boundary of each UV island is written — one closed `POLYLINE`
per boundary loop. Interior lines (the mesh topology inside the
perimeter) are never exported. Interior *holes* in an island are real
cut lines and are included by default; untick **Include Holes** to
export strictly the outermost perimeter of each island.

### 3. Auto scaling from a Freestyle edge
Mark one edge as a Freestyle edge (*Edit Mode → select an edge → Edge
menu → Mark Freestyle Edge*) to use it as the scale reference. On
export, the add-on measures that edge's real 3D length (world space,
object scale and scene unit scale included) and its length in the UV
layout. If they differ, the derived scale factor is applied to the
whole DXF, so the drawing comes out at real-world size in the unit you
pick (millimeters by default). If several edges are marked, a
length-weighted average is used. If none is marked, the **Manual
Scale** factor is used instead and a warning is shown.

## Installation

Grab/clone this repository, then either:

* **As an extension (Blender 4.2+):** zip the `uv_layout_dxf` folder
  (`cd uv_layout_dxf && zip -r ../uv_layout_dxf-1.0.0.zip .`) and in
  Blender go to *Edit → Preferences → Get Extensions → ⌄ (top-right)
  → Install from Disk…* and pick the zip.
* **As a legacy add-on:** zip the folder itself
  (`zip -r uv_layout_dxf.zip uv_layout_dxf`) and use *Edit →
  Preferences → Add-ons → Install…*, then enable *Export UV Layout to
  DXF (AutoCAD)*.

## Usage

1. Unwrap your object and lay out its UVs as usual.
2. In Edit Mode, select one edge whose real length you trust and mark
   it: *Edge menu → Mark Freestyle Edge*.
3. Select the object and run *File → Export → UV Layout (.dxf)* (also
   available in the UV editor under *UV → Export UV Layout to DXF*).
4. Adjust the options in the file browser sidebar and export.

### Options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix Mirroring & Rotation | on | Un-mirror flipped islands and rotate all islands about the base island so seams line up |
| Re-pack Islands | off | Re-arrange islands into rows so nothing overlaps (discards original layout positions) |
| Include Holes | on | Export interior boundary loops (holes) as well as the outer perimeter |
| Scale From Freestyle Edge | on | Derive the export scale from the Freestyle-marked reference edge |
| Unit | Millimeters | Real-world unit of one DXF unit when Freestyle scaling is active |
| Manual Scale | 1.0 | Plain UV→DXF multiplier used when no Freestyle reference is available |
| Layer Per Island | off | One DXF layer per island (`ISLAND_001`, …) instead of a single `UVLAYOUT` layer |
| Move to Origin | on | Shift the layout so its lower-left corner is at the DXF origin |

## Output format

DXF R12 (AC1009) with classic closed `POLYLINE`/`VERTEX` entities — the
most widely readable DXF flavour: every AutoCAD release since 1992,
LibreCAD, QCAD, Inkscape, and most laser/CNC toolchains open it
directly. The file contains a proper header (version + extents), a
layer table, and one closed polyline per island boundary loop.

## Notes & limitations

* Exports the **active object** only; join meshes first if you need
  several objects in one drawing.
* Modifiers are not applied; the exported layout is the mesh's actual
  UV map (what you see in the UV editor).
* Islands connected in a closed ring (every island touching two or
  more others) have no natural base island; the largest island of the
  ring is used as the base instead.
* UVs are exported from the active UV map.

## Development

The geometry pipeline (`uv_layout_dxf/uv_layout.py`) and the DXF writer
are pure Python with no `bpy` dependency, so they are unit-testable
outside Blender:

```
python3 tests/test_addon.py
```

The tests mock the bmesh structures, verify island detection, mirror
detection, base-island selection, seam alignment, perimeter/hole
extraction, Freestyle scaling and repacking, and validate the emitted
DXF with [ezdxf](https://ezdxf.mozman.at/) when it is installed.
